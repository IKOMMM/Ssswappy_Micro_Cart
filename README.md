### Original assumption: A simple racing game with an accelerating car and a limited play system.
Learning elements such as a simple progress recording system, Cinemashine to follow the player, notifications on IOS and Android.

### Extension: Redesigning the game with a change in style.
I've expanded the map by adding my own elements and added a singletone audio script.
